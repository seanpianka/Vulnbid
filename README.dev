VulnBid frontend

There are two ways to start the webserver:
* Running ./start.sh starts the uwsgi server, which is our production site. All script and template changes are not immediately reflected in the production site.
  uwsgi should start on init when the server reboots.
* Running ./start.sh --debug starts the Flask dev server on port 8080, which helps in staging. All changes are immediately reflected.

DEV NOTE: CAREFUL. JINJA2 IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO REMOTE CODE EXECUTION VIA SSTI ON USER INPUT.
Can we harden Jinja2?

NICE:
Potential performance boost if we used optimized FontAwesome? https://github.com/RoelN/Font-Awesome/tree/master/fonts * Problem is, it's not offered on a CDN.
Should I keep the HTML commented? Or boost performance?
/static/fonts/ directory even though we have none? (all on CDN)
